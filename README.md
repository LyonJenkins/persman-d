# PERSMAN
A deprecated personnel management tool built with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

## About

A video showcase is here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxKYfj0BRo0. This project is definitely outdated and should not be used, and a new system is in development. However, it was one of the first web apps I made, so I feel it should be showcased in some way.

## Uses

The project was made as an alternative to paid applications such as PERSCOM. It's designed for military simulation groups that play games such as Arma 3 to manage their users and events. It was also the first web app I ever designed, and I am proud of how it turned out, being only 14 or 15 when I made it.
