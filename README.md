# PERSMAN
A deprecated personnel management tool built with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

A video showcase is here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxKYfj0BRo0. This project is definitely outdated and should not be used, and a new system is in development. However, it was one of the first web apps I made, so I feel it should be showcased in some way.
